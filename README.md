# Customer-Clustering

## Introduction

Welcome to the Customer Clustering Project! In this document, I'll provide you with an overview of my project, including its objectives, methodologies, and key findings.

### Project Overview

The primary objective of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior by segmenting them based on their purchasing patterns. By applying data mining techniques, I aimed to uncover meaningful insights that would enable the retail store to tailor its marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.


### Approach
Our approach was as systematic as it was ambitious. We began by meticulously preparing and cleaning the dataset, ensuring that our subsequent analyses would be built on a solid foundation. Next, we delved into the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, a powerful framework for understanding customer behavior. By dissecting customer transactions through the lens of RFM, we gained invaluable insights into their purchasing habits and preferences. With our data primed and ready, we embarked on the exciting journey of model building. We deployed three clustering algorithms—K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN—each offering its own unique perspective on customer segmentation. From clear-cut segmentation to hierarchical relationships and noise detection, these algorithms provided us with a comprehensive view of the customer landscape.


## Project Objectives

The primary goal of our project was to segment customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. By leveraging this approach, we aimed to identify distinct customer segments that would enable the retail store to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall business performance.

## Methodologies

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

We began by reading and understanding the dataset, which contained transactional data for a UK-based online retail store. Our data cleaning process involved handling null values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types to ensure consistency and reliability. Additionally, we addressed outliers to prevent skewness in our analyses.

### RFM Analysis

The core of our project revolved around RFM analysis, where we evaluated customer behavior based on three key metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. These metrics allowed us to categorize customers into distinct segments, providing valuable insights into their purchasing habits and preferences.

### Model Building

We implemented three clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. Each algorithm offered unique advantages, such as clear-cut segmentation (K-means), hierarchy exploration (Hierarchical Clustering), and noise detection (DBSCAN). By leveraging these algorithms, we aimed to uncover diverse customer segments and guide strategic decision-making.

## Key Findings

Our analysis revealed several noteworthy findings:

- K-means clustering provided clear segmentation of customers based on purchasing patterns.
- Hierarchical clustering unveiled hierarchical relationships between customers, offering a nuanced view of groupings.
- DBSCAN effectively identified outliers and less dense regions within the data, enhancing our understanding of customer behavior.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Customer Clustering Project provided comprehensive insights into customer behavior, enabling targeted marketing initiatives, personalized customer engagement, and strategic decision-making. By leveraging data mining techniques and clustering algorithms, we laid a robust foundation for future business growth and adaptability in the dynamic retail landscape.
